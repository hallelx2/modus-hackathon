# SynthesisAI Documentation

## Introduction

SynthesisAI is an advanced research synthesis platform that combines the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Knowledge Graphs to revolutionize the research process. By leveraging artificial intelligence, the platform transforms how researchers interact with academic literature, enabling efficient analysis, synthesis, and generation of research insights.

Whether starting with a single PubMed paper, a novel research idea, or an uploaded document, SynthesisAI provides comprehensive research analysis and synthesis capabilities. The system excels at generating systematic reports and guiding users through systematic reviews using Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) technology.

## System Architecture

SynthesisAI employs a sophisticated multi-layer architecture designed to process, analyze, and synthesize research content effectively. Let's explore each layer in detail:

### 1. Data Retrieval Layer

The initial layer focuses on intelligent data acquisition from research databases. Key features include:

- **Intelligent Search Processing**: Utilizes LLM technology to generate precise MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) terms from user inputs
- **Database Integration**: Direct integration with PubMed and other research databases
- **Smart Query Generation**: Converts user research interests into optimized database queries
- **Adaptive Search**: Adjusts search parameters based on initial results and user feedback

### 2. Text Processing Layer

This layer implements a sophisticated three-tier chunking system for optimal text processing:

#### Section-Based Chunking
- Identifies common patterns within research papers
- Segments content based on standard academic paper structures
- Preserves logical section boundaries and relationships

#### LLM-Based Chunking
- Activates when predetermined patterns aren't detected
- Uses artificial intelligence to identify logical break points
- Ensures coherent content segmentation regardless of paper structure

#### Semantic Chunking
- Employs Natural Language Processing to detect section borders
- Maintains semantic consistency within chunks
- Implements overlap between chunks to preserve context

### 3. Embedding and Graph Generation Layer

This layer transforms processed text into a rich, interconnected knowledge structure:

#### Text Embedding
- Utilizes Google's text-embedding-004 model
- Converts text chunks into high-dimensional vector representations
- Enables semantic similarity comparisons

#### Graph Generation
- Employs LLM-powered relationship detection
- Creates edges between related content chunks
- Builds a comprehensive knowledge graph in Dgraph
- Preserves semantic relationships between different research components

### 4. RAG and Agentic Systems

The platform's advanced generation and analysis capabilities are powered by:

#### Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Leverages the graph database for context-aware generation
- Enhances output quality with relevant retrieved information
- Ensures factual accuracy in generated content

#### Agentic System Capabilities
- Parallel report section generation
- Comparative analysis across multiple research papers
- Automatic MeSH keyword generation
- Data extraction and synthesis
- Research highlight generation
